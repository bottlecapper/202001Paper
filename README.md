 Hitachi Paper for IEEE PES - A Three Layer Model for Wind Power Prediction
## Abstract
Accurate wind power prediction (WPP) is important for stable operation of power systems. However, the intermittent nature and high variability of wind causes many challenges. This paper proposes a three-layer WPP model considering the data from historical power measurements and numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems. The first layer uses a linear model to learn the wind power generation equation. The second layer includes several non-linear models to learn the seasonality and the inertia of wind turbines. The third layer uses stacked regression to learn a hybrid combination of predictors in the previous layer. We compared the proposed approach against the state-of-the-art algorithm as well as two neural network models. Experiment results show that our approach has the best performance.
